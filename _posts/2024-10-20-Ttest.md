# T-Test: Theory and Practice

## Introduction:

The T-Test is a fundamental statistical method used to compare means when the population variance is unknown. It is especially useful when working with small sample sizes (n < 30) and is applicable under the assumption that the data follows a normal distribution. This blog post will cover the theoretical foundation of the T-Test, provide practical examples using R, and illustrate a case where the T-Test may not be appropriate.

## Theory Behind the T-Test

The primary purpose of the T-Test is to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two groups or between a sample mean and a known value.

### Types of T-Tests

1. **One-Sample T-Test**
   - **Description**: Compares the mean of a single sample to a known value (e.g., a population mean).
   - **Hypothesis** :
         - Null Hypothesis: The sample mean is equal to the known value.
         - Alternative Hypothesis: The sample mean is not equal to the known value.
