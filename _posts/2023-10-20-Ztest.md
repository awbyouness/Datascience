# The Z-Test: Theory, Practical Application, and Limitations

The **Z-Test** is one of the most fundamental parametric tests in statistics, widely used when comparing population means, provided certain assumptions hold true. In this blog, we will explore the theoretical background of the Z-Test, walk through practical examples using **RStudio**, and highlight scenarios where the test fails to perform adequately.

## 1. Z-Test: Theory

### Purpose:
The **Z-Test** compares sample means against a known population mean or compares the means of two independent samples. It assumes that the population variance is known and the sample size is sufficiently large (n > 30). This test leverages the properties of the normal distribution to make inferences about population parameters.

### When to Use:
- **Large samples (n > 30)**: The Z-Test assumes the sampling distribution of the sample mean is normal, based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). 
- **Known population variance**: A Z-Test is appropriate when the population standard deviation is known.
- **Normal distribution**: Data should be approximately normally distributed, especially for smaller samples.

### Types of Z-Tests:
1. **One-Sample Z-Test**: Compares the mean of a single sample to a known population mean.
2. **Two-Sample Z-Test**: Compares the means of two independent samples.
3. **Z-Test for Proportions**: Compares the proportions of a certain attribute in one or two samples against a population proportion or between two groups.

### The Formula:
For a **one-sample Z-Test**, the test statistic is calculated as:

$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$

Where:
- \(\bar{X}\) = sample mean
- \(\mu\) = population mean
- \(\sigma\) = population standard deviation
- \(n\) = sample size

For a **two-sample Z-Test**, the formula is:
\[
Z = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}
\]

## 2. Z-Test: Practical Examples in RStudio

Now, let’s demonstrate the Z-Test in practice using **RStudio**. We’ll walk through a one-sample Z-Test and a two-sample Z-Test with real-world data.

### Example 1: One-Sample Z-Test

**Scenario**: Suppose a coffee company knows that the average caffeine content in their coffee is 150 mg with a standard deviation of 15 mg. A new shipment is tested, and a sample of 36 cups has a mean caffeine content of 153 mg. Does this sample provide enough evidence that the new shipment’s caffeine content is higher than the average?

#### Code:
```r
# Known parameters
mu <- 150  # Population mean
sigma <- 15  # Population standard deviation
n <- 36  # Sample size
x_bar <- 153  # Sample mean

# Z-test calculation
z <- (x_bar - mu) / (sigma / sqrt(n))
z

# P-value for one-sided test (right tail)
p_value <- 1 - pnorm(z)
p_value
```
Since the p-value (0.115) is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the new shipment has a higher caffeine content.

### Example 2: Two-Sample Z-Test

**Scenario**: Two different brands of light bulbs are tested for lifespan. Brand A has an average lifespan of 800 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours (based on 40 samples), while Brand B has an average lifespan of 820 hours with a standard deviation of 55 hours (based on 50 samples). Can we conclude that Brand B’s lifespan is significantly longer?


#### Code:
```r
# Known parameters
x1_bar <- 800  # Mean of Brand A
x2_bar <- 820  # Mean of Brand B
sigma1 <- 50  # Std deviation of Brand A
sigma2 <- 55  # Std deviation of Brand B
n1 <- 40  # Sample size of Brand A
n2 <- 50  # Sample size of Brand B

# Z-test calculation
z <- (x2_bar - x1_bar) / sqrt((sigma1^2 / n1) + (sigma2^2 / n2))
z

# P-value for two-tailed test
p_value <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z)))
p_value

```

With a p-value of 0.0616 (slightly above 0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. There is weak evidence that Brand B’s lifespan is longer, but it is not statistically significant.
